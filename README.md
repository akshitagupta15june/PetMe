## Inspiration💡

Each year, it's estimated that more than one million adoptable dogs and cats are euthanized in the United States, simply because too many pets come into shelters and too few people consider adoption when looking for a pet.

**The number of euthanized animals could be reduced dramatically if more people adopt pets instead of buying them. When you adopt dogs and cats, you save a loving animal by making them part of your family and open up shelter space for another animal who might desperately need it.**

Researchers and animal welfare activists apprehend that in the wake of misinformation linking the disease to pets and local community animals, the stray animals may be deprived of food and essential veterinary care.

We are following the policy of saving lives, saving animals and we built **PetMe** in this hackathon.

## What it does⚙️

### Test here [PetMe](https://akshitagupta15june.github.io/PetMe/)

**Our project is PetMe, a platform that allows animals to be adopted, donated to pet lovers, and provides emergency medical care to stray animals in need.**

🤖 The first feature is **Animal Adoption**, which allows users to choose an animal they want to adopt and submit their details so that the owner can reach out to them regarding adoption details. 

🤖 The next feature is **Pet Donation**. In these hectic times, pet owners may not be able to provide proper care to their pets because of their business. In such instances, they donate the pet to another person who can adopt the animal.

🤖 All the data will be stored in a database and as soon as a person add the details of a pet animal they want to donate so their details will be shown in the adoption menu.

🤖  Our platform also provides **SOS reports**, as the population of stray animals is increasing, and stray animals cannot stand harsh weather conditions, and sometimes they are injured by accidents. Therefore, if a person notices any stray animal in harsh conditions, they can fill out the details and a representative will reach the location to assist the animal with medical aid. 

🤖  Users can also **contact us** through the contact us form and one of our team members will contact them shortly.


## How we built it ⚙️

We have built this website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and connected backend database with postman API's

## Challenges we ran into 🙁

**Brainstorming:** it took our team a while to develop a website that is unique and had a real societal influence. 

**Building:**  It is also a challenging Hackathon that we need to work in new areas which we were unfamiliar with, such as handling databases to build a good project. Handling both backend and frontend at the same time within a weekend is also a big challenge for us. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 😇

We are proud that we built a website in which pet lovers can easily adopt stray animals through our website, which not only provides medical assistance to stray animals, but allows them to be adopted by their comrades in the community.

## What we learned 🤔

In addition to learning Tailwind CSS, we connected the backend API in order to store the information entered by donors and adopters.

## What's next for PetMe 📲

In the future, we plan to scale this application more to reach as many people as possible and facilitate adoption and donation of animals.

Furthermore, we plan to connect with the nearest government organization that provides medical assistance to stray animals.

## How we have used **Github** in our project? 🚀

We used Github in different ways:

**Pull Requests and Issues:** We created pull requests on our GitHub repository as we were a team of three and we're working on our local repository. If any of our team members gets an idea for a new feature, she would suggest it for all members to see and receive their opinions on how to implement it.

**Github Branches** Github branches helped a lot for beta testing of updated code before merging the new code into the original code. Our team approximately created 2-3  branches during the hackathon.

**Github Pages** we deployed our website at https://akshitagupta15june.github.io/PetMe/ using Github pages. It was really simple to deploy our site through GitHub pages and we are planning to use this feature in future hackathons.

**Github Templates** We used the Github default LICENSE template for adding an MIT license to our project.

**Github Actions** Although implementing the actions was a kind of hectic task for our team but we tried to implement them for our pull requests. We still had to learn about GitHub's actions for future hackathons.
